\textbf{Problem 3.1}:
Prove that there exists a deterministic Turing machine with oracle for
SAT that works in polynomial time, and that given a positive integer n finds its decomposition into prime numbers:
$n = p^{\alpha_1} \cdot...\cdot p^{\alpha_k} $ where $p_1 < ... < p_k$ are prime numbers, and $\alpha_1,...,\alpha_k$ are positive integers.


{\bf Solution}:

Let's observe, that for given $n, n\in \mathbb{N}$, SAT problem can be used to find it's decomposition into positive numbers $x, y$, such that $n = x \cdot y$. That construction is described in Appendix.

Now, we simply do the following: 
Start an algorithm from $n$; check whether it is prime, using AKS algorithm. If it is, finish, otherwise find it's $n = x\cdot y$ decomposition, using algorithm described in Appendix. Now, do the same for both it's $x, y$ factors.

This way, we obtain decomposition $n = p_1 \cdot p_2 \cdot ... \cdot p_m, \forall{i \in \{1, ..., m\} }$ $p_i$ is prime. Now, to find all $\alpha_i$ numbers from problem description we just sort all $p_i$ and group it.

Whole solution is polynomial-time in obvious way, thus we proved such TM exists.


\textbf{Appendix:}

Let's consider problem of determining decomposition of given $n \in \mathbb{N}$ into factors $x,y$, such that $x, y \geq 2, n = x \cdot y$ using SAT. Let's say that $n$ is given in binary representation $z_1,z_2,...,z_k$, $z_i$ representing each digit. 
We will be using variables $x_1, ..., x_k$ and $y_1, ..., y_k$ to mark representation of $x, y$ numbers. Let's observe, that multiplication of binary numbers consists of addition of maybe shifted numbers, which is easy to obtain if we implement addition.

$z_i \implies XOR(x_i, y_i, z_{i+1})$ implements addition.

Now, for multiplication 10101 * 1101, we do
10101(0) + 10101(2) + 10101(3) (number in parentheses means positions to shift left)
= 10101000 + 1010100 + 10101
We need to remember that we only need to find factors $\geq 2$, so in our formula we must have additional clauses that forces any of $x_1, ..., x_{k-1}$ being 1, same with $y_1, ..., y_{k-1}$.
