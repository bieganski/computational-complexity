\textbf{Question}:
Consider words of the form $w_1w_2 ...w_{2m}$, where all $w_i$ are words of
length m over the alphabet $\{0, 1\}$. Let $Perm$ be the set of those words of this form in which the
words $w_i$ are pairwise different (i.e., these are permutations of all m-bit numbers). Prove that
$Perm$ belongs to log-space uniform $AC0$.



{\bf Solution}

Let $n$ be the input size ($n = m \cdot 2^m$). I construct circuit described below, that recognizes language $Perm$.

First, our TM ensures us that length of input word $1^n$ equals $k\cdot2^k$ for any $k \in N$ and returns that $k$. It can be done in $log(n)$ space (in appendix I add algorithm for similar computation).
Having $k$ (equals to $m$ from task description), we construct circuit as presented below:

Let $S_n$ be the set of all words of length $n$ over alphabet $\{0,1\}$.

For word $w$ let's define as $C_w$ circuit, that for input $v$, such that $|v| = |w|$ returns 1 if and only if $w = v$. In general, comparison of two same-length words can be simply obtained by $AND$ gate of $|w|$ fanin over $XNOR$ gates per each letter. In our case we are given $w$ word, thus our input is single word, and for each position $i$ we generate $NOT$, if $w[i] = 0$ and do nothing if there was $1$ ($AND$ gate connected directly to input).
Depth of such circuit is $O(1)$, and construction TM uses logarithmic space (it needs to remember bunch of positions (in binary) that will be connected to $AND$ gate, length of such a representation is $log_2(1) + log_2(2) + ... + log_2(|w|) = log_2(1+2+...+|w|) = O(log_2(w))$).



For each input word $w$ of length $k\cdot2^k$ let's define $I_{w}$ as the set of all well-formed infixes. Well-formed means here, that $I_w$ contains only infixes of length $k$, starting at positions $\{0, k, 2k, ... , 2^k - k\}$ (simply, numbers that maybe are permutations).
\\\\

Now, let's say we generate circuit for word $w$, $|w| = m\cdot2^m$.
For each well-formed infix from $I_w$ we generate circuit $C_v$ for every word $v$ from $S_{|w|}$, and we connect both them. This way we obtain $2^m \cdot 2^m = O(n^2)$ results. 
\\

Word $s, |s| = m$ is part of* input $w$ iff. any of circuits $C_s$ returns 1 (there is $2^m$ such circuits). Our task is to check, whether all words from $S_n$ are part of $w$. Thus, for each word $s, s \in S_n$ we add an $OR$ such that it is connected to outputs of all $C_s$ circuits. It returns 1 iff. $s$ is part of $w$.
Now, it is enough to put one $AND$ gate at the top, for $\forall{s \in S_n}$ symbol, connected to each $OR$.

* being part of $w$ I define as belonging to $I_w$.


\textbf{Belonging to uniform AC0}

Presented circuit belongs to AC0 in obvious way. Depth is constant and size is polynomial. Now, let's consider TM that given $1^n$ input generates that circuit.

\textbf{Appendix:}

keep counter $k$, equals to 0 at the beginning and counter $i = 1$. Each iteration do the following:
Starting from cell 0, go $2*i - 1$ cells right. Increase $k$ by 1. If head is over 1, and on it's right there is $blank$, then return $k$. If head is over blank, throw error (input word's length is not in $2^k$ form for any k). If head is over 1, go to next iteration.
