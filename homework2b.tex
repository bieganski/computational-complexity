\textbf{Question}:
Consider words of the form $w_1w_2 ...w_{2m}$, where all $w_i$ are words of
length m over the alphabet $\{0, 1\}$. Let $Perm$ be the set of those words of this form in which the
words $w_i$ are pairwise different (i.e., these are permutations of all m-bit numbers). Prove that
$Perm$ belongs to log-space uniform $AC0$.



{\bf Solution}

Let $n$ be the input size ($n = m \cdot 2^m$). I construct circuit described below, that recognizes language $Perm$.

First, our TM ensures us that length of input word $1^n$ equals $k\cdot2^k$ for any $k \in N$ and returns that $k$. It can be done in $log(n)$ space (in appendix I add algorithm for similar computation).
Having $k$ (equals to $m$ from task description), we construct circuit as presented below:

Let $S_n$ be the set of all words of length $n$ over alphabet $\{0,1\}$.

For word $w$ let's define as $C_w$ circuit, that for input $v$, such that $|v| = |w|$ returns 1 if and only if $w = v$. It can be simply obtained by $AND$ gate of $|w|$ fanin over $XNOR$ gates per each letter. Depth of such circuit is $O(1)$.

For each input word $w$ of length $k\cdot2^k$ let's define $I_{w}$ as the set of all well-formed infixes. Well-formed means here, that $I_w$ contains only infixes of length $k$, starting at positions $\{0, k, 2k, ... , 2^k - k\}$ (simply, number that maybe are permutations).

Let's say we generate circuit for word $w$, $|w| = m\cdot2^m$.
For each infix from $I_w$ we generate circuit $C_v$ for every word $v$ from $S_{|v|}$.

Let's observe, that we obtain $2^m \cdot 2^m = O(n^2)$ results.


\textbf{Appendix:}

keep counter $k$, equals to 0 at the beginning and counter $i = 1$. Each iteration do the following:
Starting from cell 0, go $2*i - 1$ cells right. Increase $k$ by 1. If head is over 1, and on it's right there is $blank$, then return $k$. If head is over blank, throw error (input word's length is not in $2^k$ form for any k). If head is over 1, go to next iteration.
